Explanation of different Terms

---
CIR	co-rotating interaction regions
---
fast-speed solar wind streams
When a SIR is observed for more than one solar rotation, it is called a CIR

---
GCR	galactic cosmic rays
---
high-energy particles accelerated at shock fronts of distant supernova explosions

---
GLE	ground-level enhancement (events)
---
The SEP events detected at Earthâ€™s surface are called ground-level enhancement (GLE) events.

---
GIC	geomagnetically induced currents
---
intense, low-frequency currents induced in large conductive systems like power lines and pipelines$
