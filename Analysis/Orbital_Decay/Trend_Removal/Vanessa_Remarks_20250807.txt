I leave you with the suggested tasks that we discussed:
- fix GitHub repository problems.
- work on trend removal from the decays (end goal is to be able to assess when the orbit is disturbed and categorize this e.g. low, medium, strong effects).
- look at the period spectrum of decay rates and assess if and how the solar rotation period could be cleaned from the data; additionally assess if the remaining higher frequency variations are significant (those at ~5 days).
- look at old group meeting reports and add relevant figures to the paper (just drop them in with a caption). 
- review the work already done on assessing subset lengths relevant for computing statistics - review outcomes and document briefly both positive and/or negative findings.
- regarding the data, let’s make the file transfer of the adjusted datasets in person next week. 

Regarding the lowess smoother I mentioned for trend finding: A regular linear fit would be heavily impacted by outliers since it would
    i. account equally for nearby and far-away points
    ii. account equally for points that yield high residuals (e.g. the 3-sigma deviated decays during the strong event). 

With lowess, which is basically just weighted linear regression in local intervals, these are both alleviated. There is one main parameter called frac
(fraction of the data used in the fit). For frac=1, all the data is used for the estimation. Frac * len(data) closest points to the current point (xi, yi)
to estimate are considered, and their contribution to the fit is weighted by their distance to xi. In addition, lowess accounts for a secondary weighting, 
namely by multipling the distance weights by the bisquare function of the corresponding residual at xi. As a result, points with high residuals = outliers 
end up having very low weights. This is one way I could think of finding the trend, but I’m very open to hearing your ideas if you may have others.

Please find the link to the function/library I used below, and a comparison of outputs from a linear vs a lowess fit.
